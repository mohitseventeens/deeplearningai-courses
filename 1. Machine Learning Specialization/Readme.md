# Machine Learning Specialization
The Machine Learning Specialization is a foundational online program created in collaboration between DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online.

## Courses:

**Course 1:** Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification

In the first course of the Machine Learning Specialization, we will:
- Build machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy and scikit-learn.
- Build and train supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including linear regression and logistic regression.

**Course 2:** (to be added later...)
